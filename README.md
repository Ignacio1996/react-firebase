# react-firebase
React Native and Firebase simple login system

You should have the Expo development tools for react native for this to work.
After this, create a Firebase project, pick web, and copy the config variables.

## Make sure you have react-native-cli tools installed, then npm install.

Create a new file called config, and paste the contents of the native configuration given by Google Firebase.

##  I use expo, so after installing dependencies and setting up the config file, type expo start on your command line.

## Happy coding!
